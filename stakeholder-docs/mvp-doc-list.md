You’re running a pilot, not founding a new nation. Keep the paperwork tight, scoped, and actually useful. Here’s the minimum viable set of documents, in a logical order, that gets Bare from handshake to live trial without tripping legal, ethics, or ops. I’ve flagged why each exists so you can shut down the inevitable committee creep.

# 1) Governing & commercial

* **Pilot Charter & Trial Plan**
  Objectives, scope, arms (treatment/control/robustness subgroup), KPIs, timeline, roles, decision gates. Tie the “board-readiness” outcomes directly to this so no one moves the goalposts mid-way.&#x20;
* **SOW / Letter of Agreement**
  Fixed pilot scope, fees if any, responsibilities, cancellation, IP boundaries, data residency.
* **Data Processing Addendum (DPA) / Data Sharing Agreement**
  Legal basis, purpose limitation, retention, sub-processors, cross-border rules, audit rights, deletion on exit. This aligns with the “trust by design” stance you’ve promised.&#x20;

# 2) Privacy, ethics, fairness

* **Privacy-by-Design Profile**
  Pick and document the actual “privacy dials” for the pilot: identity visibility, granularity, escalation rules, cadence, retention. Include the narrow “named by exception” list and audit the paths. &#x20;
* **Pilot PIA/DPIA (short-form)**
  Identify data types, flows, risks, mitigations, worker rights, and transparency touchpoints. Reflect Echo’s consent, de-identification, and role-based access model. &#x20;
* **Fairness & Bias Note (pilot scope)**
  What you will and won’t model during the pilot, the labels used, checks for drift, and how red-team noise is handled without hurting real people. Include intent to publish customer-visible audits later. &#x20;
* **ISO 45003 Alignment Sheet (2 pages)**
  Map the pilot’s identify-assess-control-review loop to ISO 45003 guidance and local WHS duty. This keeps Safety/Risk happy and stops endless “is this compliant?” emails. &#x20;

# 3) Worker-facing consent & comms

* **Participant Information & Consent (plain-English, 1 page)**
  What Echo is, what it isn’t, opt-in/opt-out, how to reschedule, “what Echo stores about me,” and the exceptions policy. Keep it human, not HR-bot.&#x20;
* **Launch FAQ & Poster/Message Copy**
  Why answer the phone, tone, trust receipts, examples of “you said, we did.” This is the difference between participation and tumbleweeds. &#x20;
* **Robustness Subgroup Brief**
  Voluntary “stress-test” rules: what gaming is allowed, what’s out of bounds, no performance impact, and how their data is labelled. Ethics clear, zero surprises.

# 4) Supervisor & safety operations

* **Supervisor Playbook**
  How to read heatmaps and action lists, service levels for fixes, what not to do, and how to log “we did” receipts.&#x20;
* **Escalation SOPs (named-by-exception)**
  Pre-agreed triggers like self-harm threats, violence, intoxication, critical fatigue; who gets notified; timings; audit trail; worker transparency.&#x20;
* **EAP/Critical-Incident Contact Sheet or MOU**
  Phone numbers, availability windows, data handoff boundaries. You don’t want to invent this at 2 a.m.

# 5) Data & security pack

* **Data Schema & Flow Diagram**
  Minimal fields required, sources, retention, access controls, deletion process. Keep it boring and precise. &#x20;
* **Security Overview (pilot scope)**
  Encryption, tenancy isolation, logging, residency options, breach notification path. Yes, it fits on one page.&#x20;
* **Channel Readiness Note**
  Telephony/WhatsApp configuration, caller ID policy, send windows. No app required; say it plainly.&#x20;

# 6) Measurement & reporting

* **KPI & Measurement Plan**
  Define coverage, signal quality, time-to-intervention, risk movement on ISO-45003 hazards, and trust sentiment. Include how red-team noise is tracked. &#x20;
* **Weekly Pilot Note Template**
  One page to the sponsor: participation, hotspots acted, exceptions audited, trust receipts shared.
* **Board-Ready Evidence Pack Template**
  ISO-45003 readiness dashboard/CSV, intervention audit trail, and narrative. This is the product of the pilot, not an extra.&#x20;

# 7) Trial design & governance detail

* **Randomisation & Cohort Assignment Note**
  Who’s in treatment/control, inclusion criteria, and handling of attrition. Write it once to avoid politics later.
* **Risk Register & Issues Log (pilot)**
  Low pickup, supervisor inaction, escalation misfires; counters and owners.
* **Change Control Log**
  Any prompt/cadence tweak during the pilot gets logged, or your results get shredded by skeptics.

# 8) Close-out & decommissioning

* **Close-Out Report**
  Results vs control, limitations, scale recommendation, and the evidence pack attached.&#x20;
* **Data Deletion/Export Certificate**
  Confirm export to Bare and deletion from pilot environments per the privacy dial you chose.&#x20;

## Owner and timing cheat sheet

* **Before kickoff:** Charter & Trial Plan; SOW/DPA; Privacy-by-Design Profile; PIA/DPIA; ISO-45003 Alignment; Consent pack; Escalation SOPs; Channel Readiness.&#x20;
* **At launch:** Supervisor Playbook; FAQ/Poster copy; Data Schema; Security Overview; Randomisation Note.
* **Weekly:** KPI Note; Issues Log; Change Log; “You said, we did” receipts.&#x20;
* **End:** Close-Out Report; Evidence Pack; Data Deletion/Export Certificate.&#x20;

Yes, it’s a stack. No, it’s not optional if you want trust and credible results. The point is to keep every item short, specific, and tied to the pilot outcomes you promised the founder: reach people, surface risk early, act fast, prove it cleanly.
