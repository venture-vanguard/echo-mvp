# Echo × Bare — Pilot One‑Pager (Draft)

**Purpose**  
Stand up a small, ethical pilot to test whether Echo can: 
  1) engage in meaningful conversations with frontline workers, 
  2) measurably surface psychosocial risk signals 
  3) provide near realtime engagement signals
  4) produce an ISO-45003-ready evidence pack in 90 days

---

## Scope at a glance
- **Participants:** ~25 staff from a non-ground crew (CareLoop or phone support) as the seed cohort, plus 20 control (BAU + enagement survey via email) and 1–3 supervisors (dashboard).
- **Arms:**  
  - **Treatment (n≈20):** Weekly 90‑second check‑ins via phone call with WhatsApp, SMS reminders
  - **Control (n≈20):** Business‑as‑usual. This group completes an indusrty standard survey at the begining and end of the pilot period.  
  - **Robustness test subgroup (n≈5):** Volunteers who intentionally “stress‑test” the system (e.g., inconsistent answers, ignored calls) so we can measure false‑positives and clarity. Participation is consented and never used in performance decisions.
- **Cadence:** 1× 90‑sec check‑in per worker per week.
- **Duration:** ~10–12 weeks total: 2 weeks setup + 1 week dry‑run + 8 weeks live + 1 week close‑out.

## What Bare can expect
- **For workers:**  
  - Simple, enaging phone/WhatsApp calls; can opt out or reschedule any time.  
  - Private micro-coaching and signposting; **no raw recordings** to managers.  
- **For supervisors:**  
  - Cohort‑level heatmaps, trends, and a short weekly “what to act on” list.  
  - Named‑by‑exception alerts only for pre‑agreed critical risks (e.g., self‑harm, violence, critical fatigue).  
- **For leadership/board:**  
  - ISO‑45003‑aligned evidence pack with participation, actions taken, and trend movements.

---

## Privacy, ethics, and data
- **Consent‑based** participation; clear, plain‑English info sheet.  
- **Minimal data:** first name, mobile, team, site, manager, roster windows; optional incident/absence feed.  
- **Access:** supervisors see **cohort‑level** patterns; individual details are private except for pre‑agreed exception pathways.  
- **Retention:** pilot data retained for 12 months by default; configurable to Bare’s preference.  
- **Transparency:** periodic “you said, we did” updates to workers.

---

## Success criteria (pilot KPIs)
1. **Coverage:** ≥60% weekly active and 80% of conversations "good faith" in Treatment.  
2. **Evidence pack:** delivered and reviewed with Sam’s team.
4. **Risk movement:** Directional signals on relevant psychosocial hazards (e.g., workload, fatigue, exposure to traumatic events, civility/support).  
5. **Trust:** Positive worker sentiment about consent, privacy boundaries, and usefulness.

## Timeline
- **Weeks 0–1 (Setup):**  
  - Sign pilot charter (objectives, KPIs, privacy profile, exception list).  
  - Provide roster/contacts; configure telephony/WhatsApp; finalize agent prompts; supervisor training; worker launch pack.
- **Week 2 (Dry‑run):**  
  - 5–10 internal testers; tune timing/wording/escalations.  
- **Weeks 3–10 (Live, 8 weeks):**  
  - Weekly check‑ins, supervisor actions, mid‑pilot tune.  
  - Weekly KPIs issued to sponsor.  
- **Week 11 (Close‑out):**  
  - Results vs control, lessons learned, board‑ready evidence pack, scale recommendation.

---

## What we need from Bare (before kickoff)
- Named **executive sponsor** and **pilot manager**.  
- List of ~30 participants with team/manager/roster info; confirm robustness subgroup volunteers.  
- **Escalation contacts:** EAP and WHS on‑call.  
- Sign‑off on privacy profile and the named‑by‑exception list.

---

## Deliverables
- Weekly pilot KPI note and “you said, we did” highlights.  
- Mid‑pilot tuning memo (if needed).  
- Final report with control vs treatment deltas and ISO‑45003‑aligned evidence pack.
