# Echo × Bare Pilot Charter (1-pager)

**Purpose.** Prove Echo can surface psychosocial risk and fatigue from short calls, guide supervisors to act, and produce an ISO-45003-ready evidence pack in 90 days.&#x20;

**Scope.** \~30 participants from a non-ground crew (CareLoop or phone support) as the seed cohort. Echo runs weekly micro-check-ins by phone/WhatsApp. No apps.&#x20;

**Outputs.**

* Live team heatmaps and time-to-intervention. No raw conversations to managers.&#x20;
* ISO-45003 readiness dashboard + quarterly report.&#x20;
* List of fixes taken, with timestamps.

**Privacy guardrails.**
Preset = Union-strict: anonymous cohorts only; named by pre-agreed exception (imminent harm, threats of self-harm/violence, intoxication at work, critical fatigue). Consent first; opt-out always available.&#x20;

**Success measures.**

* ≥60% monthly active participation in pilot roster.
* ≤48-hour average from red-flag to supervisor action.
* Evidence pack delivered and reviewed with Sam’s team.&#x20;

**Timeline.**

* Week 0: Kickoff. Confirm privacy preset, exceptions, call windows. Import roster.
* Weeks 1–2: Dry run with 10–12 staff. Tune agent tone and cadence.&#x20;
* Weeks 3–8: Expand to \~30. Weekly status. Supervisor playbooks engaged.
* Weeks 9–12: Close-out report, ISO-45003 mapping, go/no-go for scale.&#x20;

**Who does what.**

* **Bare:** Name a pilot lead; approve founder intro; provide roster CSV and EAP/escalation contacts; join 30-min kickoff + 15-min weekly.
* **Echo:** Run calls, host data, triage red-flags per exceptions, brief supervisors, ship weekly status and the close-out pack.&#x20;

**Decisions Sam controls.** Scope, privacy preset, exception list, cadence. Echo executes the rest.&#x20;

**Stop/extend.** Either party can pause at any time; data retained per preset (6–12 months) unless deletion requested.&#x20;

# Comms + Consent pack (send-ready)

**Founder intro (email/Slack).**
“Team, we’re trialling short weekly check-ins with Echo to spot fatigue and psychosocial risks early. It takes \~90 seconds by phone or WhatsApp. Your honest input helps us fix issues faster. Management sees trends by team only. No raw conversations. You can opt out at any time. We’ll start with a small group and share what we learn.”

**Worker SMS (day before first calls).**
“Hi from Bare. This week you may get a short Echo check-in call. Takes \~90 sec. Purpose: surface issues early so we can act. Private to you except safety emergencies. Say ‘no thanks’ anytime.”

**Consent script (first call, 10 seconds).**
“I’m Echo. This is voluntary and takes \~90 seconds. I keep your conversation private and share only trend data with Bare, unless there’s a serious safety risk we agreed to escalate. OK to proceed?”&#x20;

**FAQ bullets for staff.**

* Why phone? Highest answer rates for frontline work. No apps or logins.&#x20;
* What does management see? Cohort heatmaps and time-to-intervention only. No raw voice.&#x20;
* Can I opt out? Yes, any time. You can also mute or reschedule.&#x20;
* What happens if there’s a safety risk? Only pre-agreed exceptions trigger an escalation to named contacts.&#x20;

# Inputs you need from Sam’s team

* Roster CSV: name, role/team, site, manager, mobile, timezone, preferred call windows.
* Exceptions list and escalation contacts; EAP details.
* Founder intro approval; pilot lead name; weekly slot for 15-min stand-up.&#x20;

# WhatsApp to Sam (copy-paste)

“Sam, here’s a 1-pager Pilot Charter and a Comms + Consent pack for the support team cohort. You control scope, privacy preset, exceptions, and cadence; we run the rest. If you’re good, nominate a pilot lead and send the roster + call windows + EAP contact. I’ll schedule a 30-min kickoff and start the dry run next week.”

If you want, I’ll tailor these two docs with Bare names and dates now.
