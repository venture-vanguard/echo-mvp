Alright, you’ve got a friendly founder’s nod and a pre-product prototype. Time to turn that hand-wave into a pilot that actually proves value without scaring the workforce or breaking any laws. Here’s a clean, logically ordered plan from “verbal yes” to “MVP pilot live,” sized for \~30 Bare people out of \~200, with a proper control and an intentional “bad-faith” red-team to pressure-test the system.

# 0) Define the MVP and the guardrails

* **MVP scope**: 90-second phone/WhatsApp check-ins; weekly cadence; simple team heatmaps for supervisors; basic ISO 45003 evidence pack for execs/board. No raw voice to managers, only cohort trends; individual guidance stays private to the worker. &#x20;
* **Privacy profile**: Start “Standard industrial” preset: crew-level heatmaps; named-by-exception only for imminent harm and critical safety risks (all paths transparent and logged). Retention 12 months. Adjust later if Bare prefers stricter.&#x20;
* **Pilot objective**: Show we can a) reach people reliably, b) surface psychosocial risk signals early, c) trigger time-boxed actions, and d) produce a board-safe evidence pack.&#x20;

# 1) Governance, ethics, and legal footing

* **Stakeholders**: Founder sponsor; Ops lead; People & Culture; WHS; Comms; a supervisor cohort; EAP contact; one union/worker rep if applicable.
* **Consent & transparency**: Clear, plain-English opt-in at first contact; workers can mute/reschedule; “What Echo stores about me” view; opt-out always available.&#x20;
* **WHS/ISO-45003 alignment**: Document how the pilot identifies, prioritises, and controls psychosocial hazards per local codes and ISO-45003 guidance; map to Bare’s duty of care.&#x20;
* **PIA + fairness note**: Attach Echo’s Privacy-by-Design summary and a short fairness review appendix for the pilot pack.&#x20;

# 2) Trial design (including the “bad-faith” red-team)

**Population**: \~30 workers across 2–3 teams that actually feel the load: funeral directors, arrangers, transfer team, call-centre schedulers.
**Arms**:

* A) **Treatment** (n≈18): Full Echo experience (weekly check-ins + cohort dashboards to 2–3 supervisors).
* B) **Control** (n≈9): No Echo; continues business-as-usual, measured via existing incident/absence data.
* C) **Red-team “bad-faith”** (n≈6, drawn from both A and B): Volunteers who agree to stress-test by gaming prompts, inconsistent answers, trying to provoke escalations, and ignoring calls. Logged as red-team in Echo’s back end, never flagged to line management. This validates robustness, false-positive rates, and comms clarity without harming anyone’s standing.
  **Ethics**: All arms are consent-based; red-team participation is disclosed in the pilot info sheet; no performance consequences; union/worker rep consulted.
  **Cadence**: One 90-sec check-in/wk, plus optional micro-pulse (1–3 items) on high-risk weeks.&#x20;
  **Engagement design**: Call windows timed to pre-shift/smoko; zero HR-speak; short, human openers; show prior fixes to build trust.&#x20;

# 3) Success metrics (decide these now)

* **Coverage**: ≥60% weekly active in Treatment, despite a hostile red-team seeded into the cohort.&#x20;
* **Signal quality**: % of risk flags with clear explanations; % noise introduced by red-team contained under a target false-positive rate.&#x20;
* **Actioning**: Time-to-intervention for cohort hotspots; % of actions closed within SLA; worker-visible “you said, we did” receipts.&#x20;
* **Psychosocial risk movement**: Directional improvement on ISO-45003-aligned hazards relevant to funeral work: workload, shift/sleep, exposure to traumatic events, role clarity, support, civility.&#x20;
* **Board evidence**: Auditor-friendly PDF/CSV pack mapping participation, controls, and incident trends to ISO-45003 domains.&#x20;

# 4) Data, access, and tech setup

* **Minimal data ingest**: Worker ID, first name, mobile, team, site, manager, roster windows; incident and absence feed if available. No medical data.
* **Channels**: Outbound phone + WhatsApp; SMS fallback. No worker app required.&#x20;
* **Privacy dials**: Crew-level analytics to supervisors; individual guidance private; named-by-exception only for pre-agreed threats (self-harm, violence, intoxication at work, critical fatigue). Every exception path is transparent to the worker.&#x20;
* **Security**: Encryption in transit/at rest; data residency as required; admin console with auditable access logs.&#x20;

# 5) Content: agent prompts, hazard map, escalation rules

* **Agent tone**: Human, brief, respectful; never corporate. Variants for calm/banter depending on the person.&#x20;
* **Hazard taxonomy**: Map prompts to ISO-45003 categories you’ll actually act on: workload, hours, traumatic events, supervisor support, civility/harassment, remote/after-hours fatigue.&#x20;
* **Escalations**: Pre-agreed “named by exception” list and response tree; EAP and critical-incident contacts wired in.&#x20;
* **Micro-psychometrics**: Drip tiny personality/state items over weeks to improve explanations without shoving a survey in people’s faces.&#x20;

# 6) Comms and training

* **Pre-brief managers**: How to read a heatmap, what not to do (no witch-hunts), how to log fixes.
* **Worker launch pack**: One-pager with the promise, the boundaries, and the opt-out; “not HR, not surveillance” spelled out; sample 90-sec flow. &#x20;
* **Trust receipts**: Periodic “you said, we did” messages to reinforce that speaking up leads to action.&#x20;

# 7) Timeline and deliverables (Perth time, start next week)

**Week of Mon 22 Sep 2025**

* Pilot charter signed (objectives, metrics, privacy profile, escalation list, arms A/B/C).
* Data Processing + PIA/fairness addendum attached to SOW.

**Week of 29 Sep**

* Data feed and channel setup; agent prompt library finalised; supervisor training; comms ready.

**Week of 6 Oct**

* Dry run with 5 internal testers; fix timing, consent copy, and escalation paging.

**Week of 13 Oct → 8-week pilot window**

* Go live wave; weekly ops: check-ins, supervisor actions, mid-point tune on cadence/tone.
* Weekly KPIs: coverage, signal quality, time-to-intervention, red-team noise containment.&#x20;

**Week of 8 Dec**

* Close-out: results vs control, board-ready evidence pack, recommendation to scale to 200.&#x20;

# 8) Runbook by workstream (checklist)

**Legal & risk**

* Sign SOW + DPA; register the exception list; file pilot PIA summary/fairness note.&#x20;

**Data & infra**

* Upload roster and manager map; provision WhatsApp/telephony; configure retention and residency; enable access logs.&#x20;

**Agent & content**

* Finalise prompts, ISO-45003 hazard mapping, escalation trees, and micro-pulses.&#x20;

**Comms & training**

* Manager walkthrough; worker one-pager and FAQ; “what Echo is/ isn’t” talk track.&#x20;

**Ops**

* Daily pickup/coverage review; audit exceptions; publish “you said, we did” receipts; mid-pilot tune.

**Measurement**

* Pre/post hazard indicators; weekly dashboards; endline pack with control vs treatment deltas.

# 9) Risks and the pre-emptive fixes

* **Low pickup**: Hit pre-shift/smoko windows; keep it 90 seconds; show prior fixes.&#x20;
* **Trust backlash**: Strict cohort-only analytics; crystal-clear consent and boundaries; no raw voice to managers.&#x20;
* **Supervisor inaction**: Train on playbooks; measure time-to-intervention and publish it weekly.&#x20;
* **Red-team poisoning**: Tag red-team on the back end; monitor false-positive rate and prompt drift; adjust wording and thresholds weekly.&#x20;

# 10) What you need from Bare this week

* Named sponsor and pilot manager; list of \~30 workers, their teams, managers, and rosters; escalation contacts (EAP, WHS on-call); thumbs-up on the privacy profile and exception list; go/no-go on the randomisation and red-team inclusion.&#x20;

If we follow this sequence, you’ll have a pilot that actually tests reality: can we reach funeral staff with short, human calls, surface predictable psychosocial risk patterns, and prove that supervisors take timely action without breaching trust. That’s the whole point. The board pack and scale decision then basically write themselves.&#x20;
